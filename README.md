"Study Time" Flash Card Sharing App by Brent Rusinow

Installation: use "git clone" to copy to your computer and then open in your preferred browser.

Technologies used: Angularjs, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, Angular Material, and Bootstrap.

Things to fix: After loading in from root route, reload of the route makes the entire window reload. $route.reload is not working.

Room for improvement: 
-further desktop styling 
-allow sharing of stacks with specific users, not just a public/private stack option
-add category to cards
-have cards shuffle before loading
-ionic
